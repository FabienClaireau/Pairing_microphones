# Pairing_microphones

The purpose of this R script is to be able to pair two microphones connected on the same acoustic recorder and to locate the position of bats (direction in particular).

1/ Use the script here. Then, if you want define a bat crossing event, you have a two choices : if you have synchronized acoustic recorders: go to 2a, if you have non-synchronized acoustic recorders: go to 2b
If you wat caracterize bat risk collision, just use this script

2a/ If you want define bat crossings and if you use 2 acoustic recorder non-synchronized, you must use:

https://github.com/FabienClaireau/Find_bat_road_crossings

2b/ If you want define bat crossings and if you use 2 acoustic recorder synchronized, just use:
